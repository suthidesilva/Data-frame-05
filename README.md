## Questions Explored

### 1. Proportion of Homes with Different Number of Bedrooms

Realtor Regina wants to visualize the proportion of homes with different numbers of bedrooms. Two types of visuals were explored:

a. **Pie Chart**: Provides a circular representation of the proportion of homes with each number of bedrooms.
b. **Bar Chart**: Utilizes bars to represent the proportion of homes for each number of bedrooms.

The recommendation for Regina is to use the bar chart due to its ease of comprehension.

### 2. Proportion of Homes with Bedroom/Bath Combinations

Regina is interested in showing the proportion of homes with various bedroom/bath combinations. Three types of visuals were considered:

a. **Multiple Pie Charts**: Pie charts were created for each number of bathrooms.
b. **Multiple Stacked Bars**: Stacked bar plots were generated to represent the proportion of bedroom/bath combinations.
c. **Grouped Bars**: Grouped bar plots were utilized to display the proportion of bedroom/bath combinations.

The recommended visualization is the grouped bar plot as it accurately represents the proportions and counts for all bedroom/bath combinations.

### 3. Proportion of Homes with a Fireplace Based on Age
